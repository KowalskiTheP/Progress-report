<p>Looks good however I don't know exactly how to read the predictions 
if anyone has an idea let me know, also I would to add other inputs such

<p>Interesting article, however not particularly fantastic I'm afraid. 
Firstly the standard of English is quite poor, to the point where at 
times I am struggling to follow the author. Secondly, it would be nice 
to have full code sections, rather than snippets without the 
encapsulating context. Mainly the use of libraries are not addressed 
(e.g. numpy and pandas are used but never explicitly imported, possibly 
confusing the reader. Or the function MinMaxScaler() is used, however 
there's no mention on which library this function belongs to). Thirdly, 
there is no explanation, comments or code outputs given with each of the
 code snippets, leaving the reader confused unless they know what this 
is doing (in which case reading this article is redundant in the first 
place). And finally, being able to see/download the full working code is
 paramount when giving examples like this! This I cannot see available. 
The article tries to cover a nice point, however seems to fall short a 
little and seems rushed. This can be seen by a rather hurried conclusion
 without too much in the way of thought process.</p>

<p>Is there a reason to increment the seq_len (i.e. window size) by 1? 
The function range() starts from index=0. By doing that, the result is

<p>Let's say I have a case where I want to predict the water level of 
some river and assume that the rainfall determined the water level.<br>Some
 external data sources delivers the the precipitation for 7 days ahead, 
so I want to predict the water level for the coming 7 days.</p><p>What 
would be the input and output size if I want to train the model with two
 features (water level and rainfall of past year). And when it is 
trained, I want to predict the water level (for coming 7 days) using 
only one feature (the precipitation).</p><p>Would the model look like this: "model = lstm.build_model([2, 50, 100, 2])"<br>And
 when it is used for predicting, will the first feature (water level) be
 filled with zeros? Or do you have any other thoughts?</p><p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Hello Jakob, thank you for the article. <br>I'm a beginner on NNs 
and, for that reason, I know I should be studying it more, but I would 
like to ask you how the input and parameters would look like if I add a 
second variable as input too. For example,  now you use a sequence of a 
"single" variable as an input, something like: <br>[  [1, 2, 3... 49, 50],  [2, 3, 4... 50, 51]. ...  ], for a time series of something like "1, 2, 3, ... n". Am I right?<br>What would be your input if you had a time series like "[1, 27], [2, 43], [3, 41], ... [n, m]"?</p>

<p>Thanks, that function shuffles the training sequences (windows) 
around so that we can make sure we're predicting based on just the 
windows individual rather than any longer term sequences or windows in

<p>In that sense, why use LSTM then? LSTM is for sequence model, where 
the ORDER matters. If you would predict based on just the window 
individual and ignore dependences across time by shuffling, then normal 
NN without LSTM would work. I just cannot see the point of using LSTM 
here.</p>

<p>Because you're still relying on the ordered sequence of the window. 
If the window was larger, say of size 1000 then you'd still be 
predicting sequential patterns in 1000 ordered data points and then 
comparing that to other 1000 window sizes.</p>

<p>Great article, very clear explanations. That being said, since I'm 
new to LSTM, I'm having hard time fitting it in a redefined problem. 
Could you please guide me a bit? What if I want to perform binary 
classification on time series with LSTM? So I have multidimensional time
 series of variable lengths, let's say from 10 to 1000 measurements each
 with 2 dimensions of features, and I want to classify such traces into 
classes 0 or 1. Is it feasible? What changes do I need to make, in 
compare to your problem? Any advice is very appreciated.</p>

<p>The Normalisation works well for the dataset provided. But when I 
have timeseries where window[0] == 0 I will have a problem because it is
 a division by ZERO, how do I go through that? <br>Thanks and nice post!</p>

<p>So I am starting with a smaller data set, 134 values that range from 
17 to 34. How would I adjust the variables to get something out of this?
 How can I renormalize back to a prediction in terms of the original 
values? Thanks.</p><p>Specifically what do I set batch_size and seq_len 
to? What do I replace the 50's with in the "predictions = ..." line and 
in the "plot_results_multiple" line?<br></p>

<p>Hey, plot_results_multiple won't work with singular plots like sin 
wave. I built the function to plot multiple forward looking predictions,
 as is the case with the last graphs in my tutorial... I would use just 
plot_results for the sin wave.</p><p>Also, I highly recommend you learn 
about matplotlib to plot results, as it's a valuable tool when you 
quickly want to visualise an output. With that you should then be able 
to figure out a plot function yourself for the data presented.</p>

<p>In your sine wave prediction example, you normalize the data with 
respect to the first element in your sequence where you take all the 
other elements, divide them by the first element, and then subtract 1. 
What's the motivation for that? And why did you normalize it that way?</p>

<p>I'm trying to treat each window as a separate example for the LSTM. 
By normalising with respect to the start of each window it allows each 
sequence to be treated relatively (as a return from the first data point
 in the sequence) rather than as an absolute in respect to the full 
data.</p>

<p>Great thought, Volatility is something I've tried to model in the 
past however I've so far found it to be far too noisy for anything 
conclusive (maybe a different approach needed). Direction is an 
interesting one, and something that could possibly be inferred from the 
later graphs above. I'm currently looking into more novel ways to use 
neural nets for momentum predictions and might write a follow-up article
 if I find something!</p>
